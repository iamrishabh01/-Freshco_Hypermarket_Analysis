# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the transaction data from Freshco Hypermarket’s home delivery service to identify key trends and areas for improvement. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency, expand market reach, and increase customer satisfaction.

# Background:
Freshco Hypermarket, located in HSR, Bangalore, introduced a home delivery service in 2021 to cater to evolving customer needs. The store maintains a comprehensive transaction data sheet at the order level to ensure seamless operations. This project aims to leverage this data to derive actionable insights.

I completed an in-depth analysis project on Freshco Hypermarket's home delivery service in HSR, Bangalore.

# Methodology:

+ **Data Collection:** Gathered detailed order-level transaction data, including order time slots, delivery areas, delivery charges, discounts, and completion rates.<br>

+ **Data Analysis:** Analyzed the data to identify patterns and trends in order distribution, delivery charges, discounts, completion rates, and customer acquisition sources.<br>

+ **Insight Generation:** Derived key insights regarding order volumes, growth areas, delivery logistics, and customer behavior.<br>

+ **Strategy Development:** Proposed actionable strategies to address identified issues and capitalize on opportunities.

# Key Insights:

+ Orders peak in the morning and afternoon, with lower volumes at night.
+ HSR Layout and ITI Layout are the most active delivery areas, while areas like Bomannahali – MicoLayout and Whitefield show potential for growth.
+ High delivery charges and low discounts impact customer orders during late night slots.
+ The overall completion rate is high, but certain areas like Cox Town need attention due to low completion rates.

# Expected Outcomes:

+ Operational Efficiency: Improved delivery logistics and reduced delivery times.
+ Market Expansion: Increased order volumes in underperforming areas through targeted marketing.
+ Customer Satisfaction: Enhanced customer experience through better pricing strategies and optimized service times.
+ Business Growth: Higher revenue and customer retention driven by data-informed decision-making.
# Conclusion:

This project aims to provide Freshco Hypermarket with a comprehensive understanding of its delivery service performance and offer strategic recommendations to optimize operations, expand market reach, and enhance customer satisfaction. By leveraging data-driven insights, Freshco can continue to grow its home delivery service and maintain its reputation as a leading supermarket in Bangalore.
